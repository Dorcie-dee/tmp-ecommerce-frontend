Heyya,
    it's nice to have you here.

This design inspo was gotten from a test exams I had to undertake for the Talent Mobility
exam which is open to ghanaian residents ONLY. 

A design was given and I was asked to replicate it as closely as I could and although it might not be as [perfect]
as it should, I'm super proud of myself, cause why not... ^_^


I'd ask to confirm if I have to divulge the functionalities of this website. Just know that it helps you add a product to cart and make payments. 

That'll be all for now.

Do check out my other projects and let's collab! I look forward to it.
